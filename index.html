            Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
            Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
            Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
            Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
            Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
            Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
            Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
            Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
            Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
        </p>
        <ul>

            The most recent major version of Python is Python 3,
            which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2,
            although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
            In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor.
            It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment,
            such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which
            are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to 
            the English language with influence from mathematics.
            Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other 
            programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
            Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope;
            such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.
            Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.

To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC,
 search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line
          </li>
          <li>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py)
               files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.</li>
          <li>
            To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest
             and easiest not to write the code in a file.
             This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.

            Python Indentation
            Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
            
            Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
            
            Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

        To get started with writing Python, open the Scratchpad and write your
        first "Hello world" Python code:
        <code

      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type,
         and can even change type after they have been set.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code
        >x = 5
        y = "John"
        print(x)
        print(y)

        <p>
            In programming, data type is an important concept.

            Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
            
            Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Text Type:	str
            Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
            Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
            Mapping Type:	dict
            Set Types:	set, frozenset
            Boolean Type:	bool
            Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview

    <section class="main-section" id="Python Lists">
      <header>Python Lists</header>
      <article>
        <p>
            Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

            Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
            
            Lists are created using square brackets:
        </p>
  
        <p>
            When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

            If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
            To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
        </p>
        <code>list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
            list3 = [True, False, False]</code>
        <p>
            The list is changeable, meaning that we can change,
             add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

            Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

            Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
            
            A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
            
            Tuples are written with round brackets.
        </p>
        <code>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
            print(len(thistuple))</code>

      <header>Python Dictionaries</header>
      <article>
        <p>
            Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

            A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and does not allow duplicates.
        </p>
  
        <code>thisdict = {
            "brand": "Ford",
            "model": "Mustang",
            "year": 1964
          }
          print(thisdict)</code>
        <p>
            When we say that dictionaries are ordered,
             it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

            Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order,
             you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

      <article>
        Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
  
        <code>a = 33
            b = 200
            if b > a:
              print("b is greater than a")</code>
       
        <p>
            Elif
            The elif keyword is pythons way of saying 
            "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
        </p>
        <code
          >a = 33
          b = 33
          if b > a:
            print("b is greater than a")
          elif a == b:
            print("a and b are equal")
        </code>
        The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
  
        <code
          >a = 200
          b = 33
          if b > a:
            print("b is greater than a")
          elif a == b:
            print("a and b are equal")
          else:
            print("a is greater than b")</code

      <article>
        With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
  
        <code>i = 1
            while i < 6:
              print(i)
              i += 1</code>

      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <article>
        A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

        You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
        
        A function can return data as a result.
  
        
        <p>
            In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
        </p>
  
        <code>def my_function():
            print("Hello from a function")</code>
        <p>
            To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
        </p>
        <code>def my_function():
            print("Hello from a function")
          
          my_function()</code>
        <p>
            Information can be passed into functions as arguments.

            Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
             You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
            
            The following example has a function with one argument (fname).
             When the function is called, we pass along a first name, 
             which is used inside the function to print the full name:
